# Forkify

App was deployed using Netlify. You can try it out on this link: https://alatincic-forkify.netlify.app
Forkify is an app for searching recipes, finding out the ingredients of a certain recipe, and it has possibility to redirect you to the page that contains instructions for making the meal from the recipe.
It used to have a possibility to upload your own recipes, but the API used for the app doesn't support uploads anymore. Only GET requests are allowed at the time.
This project is built for exercise and with the help of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.
Hope you like it :)
